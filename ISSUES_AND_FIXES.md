# Issues Encountered & Solutions Implemented

## Overview
This document outlines all the technical issues encountered during the project setup and their corresponding solutions. These fixes were necessary to get the React application running successfully with proper CSS loading and dependency management.

---

## 1. Package Installation Issues

### Problem
`npm install` failed with invalid package names and dependency conflicts.

**Error:**
```bash
npm error code EINVALIDPACKAGENAME
npm error Invalid package name "react-hook-form@7.55.0"
npm error Invalid package name "sonner@2.0.3"
npm error Couldn't find any versions for "motion/react"
```

### Root Cause
Package names contained version numbers instead of just names, and one package had an incorrect name format.

### Solution
Corrected `package.json` by removing version numbers from package names:
- Changed `"react-hook-form@7.55.0"` → `"react-hook-form"`
- Changed `"sonner@2.0.3"` → `"sonner"`
- Changed `"motion/react"` → `"framer-motion"`

## 2. Vite Entry Point Configuration

### Problem
Vite couldn't determine the application entry point.

**Error:**
```bash
(!) Could not auto-determine entry point from rollupOptions or html files
Skipping dependency pre-bundling.
```

### Root Cause
Missing `index.html` file in the root directory.

### Solution
Created `index.html` with proper script tag pointing to `/src/main.tsx`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Scan ID 365 Family</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## 3. Vite Configuration Missing

### Problem
No Vite configuration file existed for build and development server setup.

### Root Cause
Missing `vite.config.ts` file.

### Solution
Created `vite.config.ts` with React plugin and development server configuration:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 5173,
    open: true
  },
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    sourcemap: true
  }
})
```

---

## 4. Import Resolution Errors (Critical)

### Problem
UI components couldn't resolve imports due to version numbers in import paths.

**Error:**
```bash
Failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2"
Failed to resolve import "class-variance-authority@0.7.1"
Failed to resolve import "lucide-react@0.441.0"
```

### Affected Files
30+ UI component files in `src/components/ui/`

### Root Cause
Import statements included version numbers (e.g., `@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2`)

### Solution
Created automated script to remove version numbers from all import statements:
- Fixed imports for Radix UI components
- Fixed imports for class-variance-authority
- Fixed imports for lucide-react
- Applied to 30+ component files simultaneously

**Example Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2";

// After
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot";
```

## 5. React Router Context Error

### Problem
`useNavigate()` hook called outside Router context.

**Error:**
```bash
Uncaught Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component
```

### Root Cause
`AuthProvider` was wrapping `Router` instead of being nested inside it.

### Solution
Reordered component hierarchy in `App.tsx` to nest `AuthProvider` inside `Router`:

**Before:**
```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <Router>
    {/* Routes */}
  </Router>
</AuthProvider>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Router>
  <AuthProvider>
    {/* Routes */}
  </AuthProvider>
</Router>
```

## 6. CSS Not Loading (Tailwind Configuration)

### Problem
Tailwind CSS directives not working, styles not applying.

### Root Causes
- Tailwind CSS v4 alpha installed (incompatible with current setup)
- Missing PostCSS and Autoprefixer dependencies
- CSS syntax errors from v4-specific features
- Incorrect import order in CSS file

### Solutions Applied

#### 6.1 Dependency Management
- Downgraded to stable Tailwind CSS v3.4.17
- Installed PostCSS and Autoprefixer

#### 6.2 Configuration Files
Created proper configuration files:

**`tailwind.config.js`:**
```javascript
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'scan-primary-blue': '#294199',
        'scan-secondary-orange': '#FF9E1E',
        // ... more custom colors
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [require('tailwindcss-animate')]
}
```

**`postcss.config.js`:**
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

#### 6.3 CSS Syntax Fixes
- Removed v4-specific `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));`
- Corrected CSS import order (Google Fonts before Tailwind directives)
- Replaced problematic `@apply` directives with standard CSS

**Before:**
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap');

@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));
```

**After:**
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap');

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Dark mode variant - removed for Tailwind v3 compatibility */
```

---

## 7. Dependency Version Conflicts

### Problem
Tailwind CSS v4 alpha incompatible with existing packages.

**Error:**
```bash
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error peer tailwindcss@">=3.0.0 || insiders" from tailwindcss-animate@1.0.7
npm error Found: tailwindcss@4.0.0-alpha.25
```

### Root Cause
Tailwind v4 alpha has breaking changes and compatibility issues with existing ecosystem.

### Solution
Downgraded to stable Tailwind v3.4.17 for production reliability and compatibility.

---

## 8. Incorrect Import Paths

### Problem
Some files were importing components from incorrect paths.

**Error:**
```bash
Module not found: Can't resolve './components/...'
```

### Root Cause
Import statements referenced `/components` instead of `/src/components` directory.

### Solution
Manually corrected all import paths to use the proper `/src/components` directory structure. All components should be located in `/src/components` for proper module resolution.

---
